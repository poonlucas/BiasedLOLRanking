# BiasedLOLRanking
 Attempt at ranking player performance biased to a personal friend group using supervised learning with Neural Networks

# Motivation
To gain more experience with supervised learning with neural networks. This project is a personal exploration to see if neural networks can learn human bias. The goal of this project is to train a neural network that could rank player performance in a league of legends game in a team that is biased to our friend group’s rankings. There are currently many tools out there that ranks player performance in a game of league of legends already, but within my group of friends, we often found them to be not accurate to what we believe is the correct rankings, due to many reasons such as:
1) They are generalized over the whole population of players of different skill levels and may not accurately reflect our friend group’s skill level
2) We may have some bias within our friend group on deciding what we determine as impactful, (rankings out there are refined by professionals and are probably more accurate than any model we make, but in the end, the goal of the project is to get predict rankings based on our bias)
3) Perhaps there are some moments in the game where the result of the game is hugely affected by, but not reflected by the statistics of the players (thought is, could a neural network possibly learn these?)
Honestly, I don’t expect much to come out of building this neural network supervised model, but I believe it will be a good learning experience to use the tools and theory I learnt in CS540 Intro to Artificial Intelligence at UW Madison.
